Modern portfolio theory shows that investors can achieve optimal returns by investing in a diversified portfolio of investments included in an efficient frontier. The standard applications of modern portfolio theory investing include an efficient frontier of stocks, bonds and cash equivalents. Furthermore, modern portfolio theory outlines how a portfolio can vary its asset mix to tailor to the risk tolerance of the investor. asset allocation funds provide a simplified application of modern portfolio theory with varying allocations and combinations of assets for investors. One of the most common types of asset allocation funds is a balanced fund. A balanced fund implies a balanced allocation of equities and fixed income, such as 60% stocks and 40% bonds. Investors will find numerous funds deploying the 60/40 mix as it has become a popular standardized strategy for investors seeking broad market diversification. Asset allocation funds also offer varying levels of diversification based on risk tolerance. Investors seeking additional investing categories beyond just 60/40 will find many options, including conservative allocation funds, moderate allocation funds and aggressive alloca\\xadtion funds.', 'So basically what we did was apply MPT the moment we bought more than just equity', \"i'm not sure MPT recommends it or whether that's what the market recommends as balanced but i thought our model had 30% cash or smth AHHAHAHAH\", \"this is where i'm stopping for my part\", \"i'm gonna be roughly:\\n- what are asset classes\\n- current asset class classifications\\n- characteristics\\n- correlation between asset classes so the last point will be a bit linked to mpt alr\", 'Was wondering when u were gonna ask', 'HAHAHAH', 'Sure', 'Fk bro not good i sick of cancelling plans to meet for this fking project only to be cancelled on but sian he also busy w work then not like i should fault him zzzzz', 'Yeah after my meeting at 8 i got plans after', 'But if we skype', 'I assume it’s at night no meh', 'So i’ll have to cancel that then sian lo', 'HAHAHAHA late is how late', '😂', 'I planned supper for 11 leh lOL', 'By the time supper end like 1230 prob', 'Sure', 'Sounds good', 'Nah not today needa chiong this report', 'Bro u familiar w the loans side processes?', 'Sian nah one of the reports i reading talk about syndicated loan process improvements through blockchain but i not sure if relevant to CUB', 'Nope but i need go to a dbs branch to get a document signed if tower 3 can’t then i’m heading to plaza sing', 'Sure', 'Let’s go', 'Was in a meeting lol did u go alr?', 'Sure', 'Sure', 'Come see my slides', 'Time?', \"sup bro paiseh i was out it's ok uh i'll settle i guess unless u did the tech industry summary already bro between thailand and vietnam which country more impt for the model\", 'Huh?

So, a portfolio of bonds with high yields would have low convexity and subsequently, less risk of their existing yields becoming less attractive as interest rates rise.\\n\\nConsequently, zero-coupon bonds have the highest degree of convexity because they do not offer any coupon payments.

are gonna give ahahahhah so on top of the model that charity donations question has im adding an additional element which is the tax deductible savings model as well as there will be an additional

feel like an idiot in CAT man another question this one ah what is the optimization process sia, is it just a series of lookups and countifs or what', 'ermmm :\") sort of fark but its damn confusing

exceed the revenue obv means you giving everything away for tax savings which is sillly like is there something missing in the chain like planned expenditure or something', 'whats a PED?', 'oh oh okok yeah i probably need to okok', 'i see it is like 250%', 'yeah', 'tahts the official number ahahaha but like i need to determine the optimal % that is the output', 'i see but the solver seems to tell me to donate everything so thats like a bit dumb', 'AHAHHAHA', 'yeah wait no not reveenue it is profit after tax', 'ded yeah i think I am going to as well', 'yeah cSR is tough man', 'i had to go

For the developmental states to continue developing, they will need to attract more multinational companies and organisations into their country. These companies and organisations will not only provide jobs, they will help to significantly impact the economic state of the country. The improvement in economic standing will also have spill over effect into the social issues the countries faces. These companies, however, operate across various regions and therefore use English as the official language for the company. Therefore, they will tend to employ workers who are able to fluently converse in the English language.\\nThe English language will also allow the leaders of the state to put across their concerns on the global without any possibility of losing the importance of their matter through translation. yo keeve!! i ask you ah for the DM mid terms will they test definitions or not', 'alright thanks then i dont waste my time memorizing definitions', 'its okay oh hahha thanks anw', 'Keeve!!!! if i ask u for help in my project can anot? or u not allowed to help?', 'thanks thanks i wont are u in lks?', 'later i come show you', 'we need do ER model for p1', 'nope', 'i think that is p2', 'when my group finish up the visio stencil i send you u just help me see if it makes sense', 'love you when u free pls help me see if it makes sense!

Let’s go tgt when Jiawei is back', 'Can I get back to you in a while? Sorry! I’m with Gwen now', 'Hi Keeve actually from my POV, if I didn’t hear about the dispute from Jiawei, I wouldn’t have thought that there’s any problem. Maybe because I’m not involved and like I didn’t put too much thoughts into it. \\n\\nAnd correct me if I’m wrong, he mentioned that you feel like he always try to be the alpha is it? As his friend who knows him for about a year, I personally never ever feel like he’s trying to overpower anyone. His personality is naturally more outgoing at times and especially in “fun settings” like club/drinking sess etc. he tends to speak more to entertain the group. And he is blunt at times, so his jokes can seem rather mean or offensive. But come on, that’s Jiawei and that’s what makes him so fun to be with. I personally have a friend who I always “bully” but I love him as a brother more than anyone else. I treat him that way because I know he can take jokes and at the end of the day, my actions show that I cherish him a lot. Same goes to your friendship with Jiawei, I’m almost certain that he doesn’t harbour ill intentions when playing with you. \\n\\nI’m really sorry if my opinion doesn’t truly reflect how you feel and I’m no position to judge also. I don’t know how you feel, I can’t read Jiawei’s mind, so as a third party, I really thought yesterday went really well and I thoroughly enjoyed it. \\n\\nSo overall, my opinion is that Jiawei is naturally more outgoing, more fun loving, and in such party situations, naturally he’ll draw more attention. However, I know very well he isn’t the kind who tries hard to seek attention or to impress people. He is just being him. (Of course, I might be wrong. I can’t read minds) I really don’t think he meant to put you down, shame you or overpower you in any way. You’re an important friend to him. And Jiawei cherishes his close friends a lot, we know that. I don’t think anybody is particularly at fault. Instead, it’s more likely to be misunderstandings and maybe all the pent up frustration in all of us. Hopefully we can all take a step back to assess the situation and don’t let our anger/frustrations cloud our judgements.', 'I’m glad to hear that!', 'No problem la hahaha btw I owe you $25 for shots and you owe me $10 for the jug so I owe you $15!

I had difficulties adapting to the drastically different way of life in Laos. Being unable, for the most part, to contact friends and family back home in Singapore meant, and having to do many things by myself, forced me to become more independent and resilient by stepping out of my comfort zone. \\n\\nThrough educating the children and doing construction, who were really willing to learn, I realised how privileged I am to be able to further my studies and be exposed to opportunities, and also how we should never take education and comfort for granted. The children that I have met and taught made a lasting impression on me as their friendliness and their genuinity came as a pleasant surprise. I also learnt that personal happiness is largely determined internally rather than by our external environment.\\n\\nOne of the most valuable things gained is the lasting friendships that have been forged through common experiences. I opened up to my friends that proved to be pillars of strength through the trip, and made many sweet and unforgettable memories through planning for activities and reflecting with one another. its like 208 words hahahah hope its okayyy thanksss', 'heheheh yayyyy im gladdd no probsss:) thanksss', 'Yupppppz i bedding hi jack Yong', 'Night class', 'Nope tues i moN got CCA', 'Tgt? 😬 yessssss', 'HAHAHAH okayyyy yayyy idk leh hahahah was thinking 14/15 you?', 'Yeah', 'Wait no no don’t just trust me', 'I also DK HAHHAHAHAAH', 'Got past sems also but I never take pic', 'I no credits :’) i scared with the amount I’m left with no enough for next sem i just scared cos he all of a sudden this sem like pretty popular?

The children live a life of fun and simplicity, something the millennials in singapore never get to experience. Waiting for an ice cream uncle, cycling home from school on the dust road, and even having a lake is exciting to them. The time spent with them was really precious. \\n\\nIn addition, the construction work we did was an eye opener to me. It was cool making cement from powder and other ingredients. We did as much as we could within the 2 weeks, and we all had one goal in mind: to construct a more conducive environment for the children to study in. The living conditions were alright, but hearing the previous expeditions’ experiences made me appreciate the facilities they have there, like lights in the toilet.

However, upon closer inspection through various recounts by Singapore’s diplomats and scholarly articles, simplistically categorising its foreign policy as a realist one would be ill-informed. What is its origin, credo, alternatives, and construction over time? This essay seeks to explore Singapore’s foreign policy in further detail, proving that there are various nuances in its foreign policy displaying strands of liberalism, marxism, and constructivism. what do you think for intro?? looks too damn long to me LOL', 'fml', 'fmlfmlfmlfml gonna get a drink lol', 'Yay okay ummmm would it be weird if I separate 1 line to a para?', 'Aight thanks', 'haha you too for ur reading tmr', 'LOL', 'I just asked ken he said its the first one boothby disarmament', 'hahaha yeah i did just now about the essay hes nice!!', 'hahaha playing your character seriously i see 😉', 'hahaha yeah hows camp?', \"LOL won't don't have camp haha not sure if I can catch the last bus gg\", 'More like trying to fluff my essay 😫 hey keeve can i borrow your laptop to print out my essay later', 'thankssss', 'nope im still doing my essay :(', 'dont read it k! its really bad rubbish wew finally done i think i could do a summary for the quiz later', \"HAHA aw thanks but I think you didn't read properly cus I know my whole essay is alot of bs haha omg helo help the floor is mega squeaky today\", 'HAHA fine my slippers can you ask to end earlier kay ill try', 'LOL 1940s\\n-military alliances: NATO VS Warsaw Pact\\n1946 the General Assembly established the Atomic Energy Commission: atomic energy to only be used for peaceful purposes. \\n-USA called for Baruch Plan (creation of atomic energy development authority for all phases of the manufacture and use of atomic energy once authority was operating effectively, atomic weapon production would cease and stocks destroyed)\\n-Soviet called for Gromyko Plan (destruction of all atomic weapons within 3 months of the convention entering into force). \\n\\n1947 the Security council established the Commission for Conventional Armaments: general reduction of armaments and armed forces other than nuclear weapons. \\n\\n1952 General Assembly combined these two commissions into a single body: the Disarmament Commission: arms limitation and reduction of armed forces, and measures to eliminate all major weapons adaptable to mass destruction. \\n\\nUnable to get the 2 superpowers to agree, the GA looked to treaties in geographical locations.

In order to remain competitive in the fast-paced and constantly changing market, it is necessary for Popular Holdings to expand into a new industry. We have decided that one of the most lucrative industry Popular Holdings could expand into would be the Tuition industry in Singapore. \\nWe would be using existing resources to cut down on start-up cost and leveraging on the reputation the company currently has to spread the word of our new expansion. To begin, we would have an outlet located in Sembawang Mall, which would also act as the headquarters for the Tuition division of our company. The outlet would be able to accommodate 10 classes of 12 students at any given time.  \\nOur administrative staff would be relocated from other business sectors in order to reduce our hiring and training expenses. Tutors would be selected from a pool of teachers with a minimum of 3 years teaching experience. Tutors are given freedom to interact with the students in order to customize the learning of each student individually. \\nOnline materials will be the key selling point of our centre. By integrating technology and moving away from traditional teaching methods, we will be providing a more engaging and interactive lesson for our students. We will also be applying vertical integration and acquiring physical materials from our publishing business sector. \\nOur prices will be set at $240/Semester in order to compete with major tuition centres in Singapore. We expect to see a return on our investments during the second year and a 120% increase in both students and profit every year. This means by the 5th year, we would experience full capacity in both student size and revenue for our initial outlet.\\nThere is a plan for expansion during our 5th year of operations, in which preparation will start as early as the beginning of the 4th year of operations. Anew outlet will be located in Simei with the same capacity as our initial outlet. Tutors will be trained for a year as trainees under current tutors in order to learn about Popular’s way of learning. bro I zao first smoke with you next time', 'Alright!! thank you keeve :) nice talking to u hehe', 'Yeah how did u find out hAHA', 'oh you have his picture?
